\title{Test for Spatial Join Count Statistics}
\usage{
join_count(matrix_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrix_data}{A binary matrix (with elements 0 and 1) representing the spatial distribution
of two types of points where 0 = healthy plant (H) and 1 = disease plant (D). This could reflect}
}
\value{
A comprehensive, rich-text formatted string of results that includes:
\itemize{
\item Statistical counts of specific binary sequences (e.g., "01 or 10", "11")
\item Expected counts under the assumption of Complete Spatial Randomness (CSR)
\item Standard deviations and Z-scores (ZHD for "01 or 10" sequences, ZDD for "11" sequences)
\item Interpretation of whether the spatial distribution for each sequence type is
"Aggregated" or "Not Aggregated" based on Z-scores
\item A summary explaining the implications of these statistics and patterns
}
The return value aims to provide a clear understanding of the spatial arrangement's
characteristics, aiding in further spatial analysis or research.
}
\description{
The function \code{join_count} calculates spatial join count statistics for a binary matrix,
identifying patterns of aggregation or randomness.
}
\details{
The function conducts an analysis by first counting the occurrence of specific sequences
("01 or 10" and "11" - equivalent to HD and DD) in the binary matrix.
It then calculates expected values, standard
deviations, and Z-scores to determine the spatial randomness or aggregation. The analysis
considers both horizontal and vertical adjacency (rook case) in the matrix.
